Hi, I’m Matin Marivani. I'm a Surveying Engineering student at Tehran University.
I’m so much interested in programming and solving problems with my code.   
I’m currently learning Basic Linux so I can use terminal easily. I'm also learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning with python.
I'm not studying Computer Science in college but I'm working really hard on my coding and how to write better and more efficient code so I am working 
alot on learning Data Structure and Algorithms.
I'm hoping that I could a job by the end of the next year as ML Engineer or python developer
